## Data Flow

1. **IoT Sensors** send real-time data → **Load Balancers** → **App Server**. IoT Sensors send real-time water quality data at an expected rate of 1 requests/sec per sensor. With 10M sensors, this results in 10M API requests per second, distributed across multiple Load Balancers before reaching the API Gateway.
2. **Write API** processes data → stores in **PostgreSQL** (structured) or **S3** (raw/historical).
3. **RabbitMQ** distributes tasks → **Worker Services** process data.
4. **Contamination Detection & AI Models** analyze data → results stored in **PostgreSQL**.
5. **Predictive Analytics & Reporting** generate insights → stored in **S3**.
6. **Notifications** sent via **Notification Service** if contamination is detected.
7. **User Dashboard** fetches data via **Read API** and displays live metrics.

---

## API Structure, Rate Limiting & Load Management

To efficiently manage **10M sensor requests per second**, the system employs **rate limiting, load balancing, and asynchronous processing**.

### API Gateway Rate Limiting Mechanism

- **Rate Limit Per Sensor** → Each IoT sensor is restricted to **1 requests per second**.
- **Exceeding the Limit** → Requests exceeding this rate receive an **HTTP 429 Too Many Requests** response.

#### Handling Excess Requests

- Sensors must **retry after a cooldown period** (e.g., **exponential backoff**).
- **Excess requests are not queued** to prevent API server overload.

### Rate Limiting Implementation

#### **Algorithm Used:**

- The system employs a **Token Bucket Algorithm** at the **API Gateway** level.
- Each sensor receives **1 tokens per second**, with each request consuming one token.
- If a sensor exceeds its token quota, it must wait until new tokens are available.

#### **API Gateway Enforces Rate Limits:**

- Implemented via **NGINX, Kong API Gateway, or AWS API Gateway**.
- Configured to automatically reject requests exceeding defined quotas.

### Load Balancing Strategy

- **DNS Load Balancer** distributes traffic across multiple **region-based Load Balancers**.
- **API Servers** are **horizontally scaled** to ensure **high availability and fault tolerance**.

### Asynchronous Processing (RabbitMQ)

- Instead of direct database writes, **sensor data ingestion is handled asynchronously**.
- **RabbitMQ queues** allow system elasticity, preventing sudden spikes from overloading the database.

## Integrating IoT Sensors and External APIs for Data Aggregation & Endpoints

### 1. Connection to High-Level Architecture

This section is directly linked to the **Ingress & API Management** and **Data Processing Layer** in the **High-Level Components Architecture**.

**Relevant Components:**

- **IoT Sensors** → Source of real-time water quality data.
- **DNS Load Balancers** → Distributes requests across multiple load balancers.
- **Load Balancers** → Manages high-throughput request distribution.
- **API Gateway** → Entry point for sensor data ingestion and external API requests.
- **App Server** → API routing, and request processing.
- **Write API** → Stores incoming sensor data into the system.
- **RabbitMQ Message Broker** → Handles asynchronous processing of sensor data.
- **External Integration APIs** → Enables municipalities, industries, and environmental organizations to interact with system data.

---

### 2. Breakdown of Data Aggregation Process

The data aggregation process involves ingesting, processing, storing, and making sensor data available via external APIs.

#### **2.1 Data Collection from IoT Sensors**

- **10 million IoT sensors** continuously send real-time water quality readings.
- **Metrics include:**
  - pH Levels (acidity/alkalinity)
  - Turbidity (water clarity)
  - Dissolved Oxygen (DO levels)
  - Temperature (°C/°F)
  - Contaminants (nitrates, phosphates, heavy metals)
- Sensors communicate with the API Gateway via **HTTP(S) or MQTT protocols**.

#### **2.2 Traffic Management & Load Balancing**

- **DNS Load Balancer** distributes incoming requests across multiple Load Balancers.
- **Load Balancers** forward requests to the App Server based on availability.

#### **2.4 Processing via App Server & Write API**

- The **App Server** routes valid requests to the **Write API**.
- The **Write API** pushes raw sensor data into **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous processing.

#### **2.5 Asynchronous Data Processing (Worker Services)**

Once sensor data enters **RabbitMQ**, it is distributed to multiple **Worker Services**:

- **Contamination Detection Service** → Detects anomalies using AI-based contamination models.
- **AI Model Inference Service** → Performs predictive analytics on sensor data.
- **Monitoring Service** → Tracks system health and potential failures.

#### **2.6 Data Storage & Caching**

After processing, data is **stored and cached** for efficiency:

- **Structured Data (PostgreSQL Cluster):** Processed sensor readings and user metadata.
- **Historical Data (Object Storage - S3):** Raw sensor data for long-term storage.
- **Frequently Accessed Data (Redis Cache):** Cached contamination thresholds and metadata for low-latency access.

#### **2.7 External API Integrations**

External systems (municipal water management, industrial plants, environmental monitoring organizations) fetch processed data using the **External Integration API**.

**APIs provide:**

- Water quality reports.

## Authentication & RBAC System Design

### **Requirements**

- User authentication via OAuth2
- Role-based access control (Operator, Scientist, Admin)
- Session management
- User profile management
- Secure password storage and transmission

---

![Authorization and RBAC](<../DIAGRAMS/PNG/Authorization and RBAC.png>)  

### **Flow Overview**

#### **1. User Request Initiation**

- A **user** makes an API request to access a service.
- The request is first routed through the **API Gateway**.
- The **API Gateway** forwards the request for authentication.

#### **2. OAuth2 Authentication**

- The **API Gateway** communicates with the **OAuth2 Authentication Service** to verify user credentials.
- If credentials are **valid**, token validation begins.

#### **3. Token Validation**

##### **Does the User Have an Access Token?**

- **Yes → Check if the token has expired.**
- **No → Check for a refresh token.**

##### **Has the Access Token Expired?**

- **No → Proceed to role validation.**
- **Yes → Check if a refresh token exists.**

#### **4. Refresh Token Handling**

- If the access token has expired, the system checks for a **refresh token**:
  - **Valid Refresh Token?**
    - **Yes → Generate a new access token.**
    - **No → 401 Unauthorized (User must log in again).**
  - If the **refresh token itself is expired**, the user must **re-authenticate**.

#### **5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

- If the access token is valid, the system checks the **user’s role**:
  - **Valid Role → Access Granted.**
  - **Invalid Role → 403 Forbidden.**

#### **6. Accessing System Services**

- If access is granted, the user is redirected to the appropriate system service:
  - **Admins:** Manage Users & Reports
  - **Scientists:** View Analytics & Water Data
  - **Operators:** Access Dashboard & Notifications
  - Other connected services include:
    - **RabbitMQ (Message Broker)**
    - **Notification Service**
    - **Predictive Analytics Service**
    - **Monitoring Service**
    - **PostgreSQL Database & Redis Cache**

---

### **Error Handling**

| Condition | Response Code | Action Required |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Invalid credentials | `401 Unauthorized` | User must log in again |
| No access/refresh token | `401 Unauthorized` | User must re-authenticate |
| Expired refresh token | `401 Unauthorized` | User must log in again |
| Invalid role | `403 Forbidden` | Access denied |

---

## Database performance and implementation caching strategies

### Database Optimization Plan for PostgreSQL

**1. Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning):**

- **Challenge Addressed:** High write throughput from 10M IoT sensors generating 10M requests/second.  
- **Solution:** Partition the database into **10 shards**, each handling 1M requests/second. Shards can be distributed based on sensor IDs (e.g., ranges of 1M sensors per shard).  
- **Impact:** Reduces write contention by **90%**, as each shard processes data independently, ensuring faster concurrent writes.

**2. Indexing:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Querying historical sensor data (e.g., "Retrieve all records for Sensor X in the last 24 hours") is slow, taking **5-10 seconds per query**.  
- **Solution:** Create **composite indexes** on `sensor_id` and `timestamp`. Use a unique index for primary keys like `sensor_id + timestamp`.  
- **Impact:** Query execution time reduces by **80%-90%**, with queries taking **<1 second** in most cases.

**3. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Tuning:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** High write latency due to excessive disk I/O from unoptimized WAL writes. Current latency is **500 ms per batch write**.  
- **Solution:** Batch WAL writes and adjust parameters like `wal_buffers` to **16MB** and `checkpoint_timeout` to **10 minutes**.  
- **Impact:** Write latency drops by **30%-40%**, reducing batch write time to **300 ms**.

**4. Read Replica Setup:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Overloaded primary database handling **70% reads** and **30% writes**, causing response delays of **3-5 seconds** for read-heavy operations.  
- **Solution:** Deploy **3 read replicas**, each handling **30% of read traffic**, leaving the primary focused on writes.  
- **Impact:** Reduces read query load on the primary by **70%**, cutting response times to **<1 second**.

**5. Table Partitioning:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Queries on tables with **1 billion+ rows** take **20-30 seconds** to process.  
- **Solution:** Partition tables based on **monthly timestamps**. For example, each partition handles **30M rows/month**.  
- **Impact:** Query performance improves by **50%-70%**, reducing query times to **5-10 seconds**.

**6. Connection Pooling:**

- **Challenge Addressed:** Spikes in concurrent connections (e.g., **10,000 simultaneous requests**) cause the database to crash or hang.  
- **Solution:** Use PgBouncer to limit connections to **1,000 active connections** and queue excess requests.  
- **Impact:** Ensures **100% uptime**, prevents crashes, and improves average request throughput by **2x**.

---

### Caching Strategy with Redis

**1. Metadata Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Repeated queries for static sensor metadata (e.g., sensor name, location) generate **10M requests/day**, causing database load.  
- **Solution:** Cache metadata in Redis with a **24-hour expiration** and invalidate only on metadata updates.  
- **Impact:** Reduces metadata query load by **90%-95%**, saving **9M daily queries**.

**2. Query Result Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Frequently accessed query results (e.g., "Last hour's sensor readings") take **1-3 seconds/query** from the database.  
- **Solution:** Cache recent query results in Redis with a **5-minute expiration** for freshness.  
- **Impact:** Reduces query response time to **<200 ms**, saving database compute for **60%-80% of repeated queries**.

**3. Threshold Data Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Frequent access to contamination thresholds for **10M sensors**, causing **500K daily database queries**.  
- **Solution:** Cache thresholds in Redis with a **1-hour expiration** and update only when thresholds change.  
- **Impact:** Eliminates **95% of threshold queries**, saving **475K database queries/day**.

**4. Session Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** High latency for user authentication queries, taking **300-500 ms/query** due to database lookups.  
- **Solution:** Store user session data in Redis with **10-minute expiration** for active sessions.  
- **Impact:** Cuts authentication query latency to **<50 ms**, improving user experience for **90% of sessions**.

**5. Monitoring Cache Efficiency:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Inefficient cache usage with a hit ratio of **50%-60%**, causing unnecessary database queries.  
- **Solution:** Monitor Redis metrics (e.g., memory usage, hit ratio) and tune eviction policies like **LRU** (Least Recently Used).  
- **Impact:** Achieves a **90%+ cache hit ratio**, significantly reducing redundant database queries.

## Predictive Analytics, Alerts, and Reporting Services

---

### 1. Component Overview

The system leverages background processing to handle predictive analytics, real-time alerts, and report generation. These services rely on **Celery workers**, **RabbitMQ** for task queuing, and **Redis** for caching. Below is the breakdown:

---

### 2. Detailed Architecture

#### A. Data Flow

##### Sensor Data Ingestion

- IoT sensors (10M devices) stream data (pH, turbidity, etc.) to the **Water Quality Service.**
- Data is batched and sent to **RabbitMQ** for task distribution.

##### Task Queuing

- RabbitMQ acts as the message broker, distributing tasks to Celery workers with a throughput of **100,000 tasks/sec.**
- Tasks include:
  - **Data Aggregation**: Combine sensor data into time-series batches.
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Trigger AI models for contamination prediction.
  - **Alert Generation**: Notify users of threshold breaches.
  - **Report Compilation**: Generate hourly/daily water quality reports.

##### Predictive Analytics Service

- **AI Model Inference**:

  - Deployed as a microservice using TensorFlow Serving/PyTorch.
  - Processes aggregated data to predict equipment failures and water quality trends.
  - Latency: **<500ms** per prediction.

- **Model Training Pipeline** (offline):

  - Retrains models weekly using historical data stored in AWS S3.

##### Alert Service

- Subscribes to anomaly detection results from the message queue.

- Triggers **Notification Service** (email/SMS) for:

  - Threshold breaches (e.g., pH > 8.5).
  - Contamination alerts from AI models.

- Uses **Redis** to cache alert templates and user preferences.

##### Reporting Service

- Generates PDF/CSV reports from aggregated data.

- Sources:

  - **PostgreSQL**: Real-time metrics.
  - **AWS S3**: Historical data (e.g., monthly trends).

- Reports are stored in S3 and accessible via the user dashboard.

#### B. Scalability & Reliability

- **Celery Autoscaling**: Workers scale horizontally using Kubernetes based on queue length.
- **Redis Caching**: Reduces database load for frequent queries (e.g., alert thresholds).
- **RabbitMQ Clustering**: Ensures high availability for task queuing.
- **Region-Based Partitioning**: Data is sharded by geographic region to reduce latency.

### 5. Key Metrics & SLAs

- **Latency**:
  - Predictive Analytics: <500ms
  - Alert Delivery: <5s (from detection to notification)
  - Report Generation: <2m (for 24-hour data)

- **Throughput**:
  - 100k tasks/sec (Celery workers)
  - 30k TPS (PostgreSQL)

---

### 6. Failure Handling

- **Retry Mechanisms**: Failed tasks are re-queued with exponential backoff.
- **Dead-Letter Queue**: Permanent failures are logged for manual review.
- **Health Checks**: Kubernetes monitors worker nodes and restarts unhealthy pods.

---

### 7. Integration with External Systems

- **Municipal APIs**: Reports are synced via External Integration API (REST/GraphQL).
- **Industrial Control Platforms**: Alerts are forwarded using webhooks.
