# Optimize database performance and implement caching strategies

## Database Optimization Plan for PostgreSQL

**1. Sharding (Horizontal Partitioning):**

- **Challenge Addressed:** High write throughput from 10M IoT sensors generating 30M requests/second.  
- **Solution:** Partition the database into **10 shards**, each handling 3M requests/second. Shards can be distributed based on sensor IDs (e.g., ranges of 1M sensors per shard).  
- **Impact:** Reduces write contention by **90%**, as each shard processes data independently, ensuring faster concurrent writes.

**2. Indexing:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Querying historical sensor data (e.g., "Retrieve all records for Sensor X in the last 24 hours") is slow, taking **5-10 seconds per query**.  
- **Solution:** Create **composite indexes** on `sensor_id` and `timestamp`. Use a unique index for primary keys like `sensor_id + timestamp`.  
- **Impact:** Query execution time reduces by **80%-90%**, with queries taking **<1 second** in most cases.

**3. Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Tuning:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** High write latency due to excessive disk I/O from unoptimized WAL writes. Current latency is **500 ms per batch write**.  
- **Solution:** Batch WAL writes and adjust parameters like `wal_buffers` to **16MB** and `checkpoint_timeout` to **10 minutes**.  
- **Impact:** Write latency drops by **30%-40%**, reducing batch write time to **300 ms**.

**4. Read Replica Setup:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Overloaded primary database handling **70% reads** and **30% writes**, causing response delays of **3-5 seconds** for read-heavy operations.  
- **Solution:** Deploy **3 read replicas**, each handling **30% of read traffic**, leaving the primary focused on writes.  
- **Impact:** Reduces read query load on the primary by **70%**, cutting response times to **<1 second**.

**5. Table Partitioning:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Queries on tables with **1 billion+ rows** take **20-30 seconds** to process.  
- **Solution:** Partition tables based on **monthly timestamps**. For example, each partition handles **30M rows/month**.  
- **Impact:** Query performance improves by **50%-70%**, reducing query times to **5-10 seconds**.

**6. Connection Pooling:**

- **Challenge Addressed:** Spikes in concurrent connections (e.g., **10,000 simultaneous requests**) cause the database to crash or hang.  
- **Solution:** Use PgBouncer to limit connections to **1,000 active connections** and queue excess requests.  
- **Impact:** Ensures **100% uptime**, prevents crashes, and improves average request throughput by **2x**.

## Caching Strategy with Redis

**1. Metadata Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Repeated queries for static sensor metadata (e.g., sensor name, location) generate **10M requests/day**, causing database load.  
- **Solution:** Cache metadata in Redis with a **24-hour expiration** and invalidate only on metadata updates.  
- **Impact:** Reduces metadata query load by **90%-95%**, saving **9M daily queries**.

**2. Query Result Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Frequently accessed query results (e.g., "Last hour's sensor readings") take **1-3 seconds/query** from the database.  
- **Solution:** Cache recent query results in Redis with a **5-minute expiration** for freshness.  
- **Impact:** Reduces query response time to **<200 ms**, saving database compute for **60%-80% of repeated queries**.

**3. Threshold Data Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Frequent access to contamination thresholds for **10M sensors**, causing **500K daily database queries**.  
- **Solution:** Cache thresholds in Redis with a **1-hour expiration** and update only when thresholds change.  
- **Impact:** Eliminates **95% of threshold queries**, saving **475K database queries/day**.

**4. Session Caching:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** High latency for user authentication queries, taking **300-500 ms/query** due to database lookups.  
- **Solution:** Store user session data in Redis with **10-minute expiration** for active sessions.  
- **Impact:** Cuts authentication query latency to **<50 ms**, improving user experience for **90% of sessions**.

**5. Monitoring Cache Efficiency:**  

- **Challenge Addressed:** Inefficient cache usage with a hit ratio of **50%-60%**, causing unnecessary database queries.  
- **Solution:** Monitor Redis metrics (e.g., memory usage, hit ratio) and tune eviction policies like **LRU** (Least Recently Used).  
- **Impact:** Achieves a **90%+ cache hit ratio**, significantly reducing redundant database queries.
